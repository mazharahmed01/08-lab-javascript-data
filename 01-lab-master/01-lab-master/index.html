  <h2>Workshops</h2>
  <p>Location: see your personal timetable</p>  
  <p>One 2-hour workshop per week (see timetable above).</p>
  <p>Practical workshops involve semi-taught lab exercises and hands-on coding, and are a focussed place to work on your assignments and develop practical skills. Attending all workshops will ensure that you keep up with the learning outcomes and work towards your individual project assignment (see below for details). Students who attend regularly tend to produce higher-quality work and gain better marks.<p>
  <h2>Your attendance at workshops counts towards the ongoing viva (10% of the final module mark). A module-wide weekly evaluation will help track and personalise the learning experience.</h2>
  <p>Work submitted without sufficient attendance may not meet the required standard, so could be rejected, and code is <b>always</b> examined for plagiarism.<p>

  <h2>Lectures</h2>
  <p><b>Location:</b> Bede Island 0.05</p>  
  <p><b>Time:</b> Thuesdays 16:00-18:00</p>
  <p>Ten 2-hour lectures, every week (see timetable above).</p>
  <p>Lectures complement the practical workshops and cover essential technical issues as well as the wider perspectives on front-end web technologies. They also contain carefully-selected links for deeper information. You will learn to make intelligent choices and predict future industry trends in this rapidly-changing and complex field.</p>

  <h2>Module details</h2>

  <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>

  <p>By the end of this module, through attendance and participation in workshops, and after successful completion of lab tasks and assignments, students will be able to:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Contextualise and critique the aims and culture driving current web technologies, how these have evolved and what part they play in modern web development.</li>
    <li>Develop a critical understanding of basic design principles, Information Architecture (IA), usability principles and semantic markup, and how these determine navigability, usability and website/webapp structure.</li>
    <li>Demonstrate evidence of a detailed understanding of the current front-end web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and make intelligent choices regarding their use and context.</li>
    <li>Create a fully standards-compliant, responsive and accessible website using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In addition, best practice in general software development (e.g. version control, consistent code indentation, etc.) will be encouraged throughout the module. These will also be part of the marking criteria for the final project.</p>

  <h3>Blackboard resources</h3>

  </ul>
  
  <h3>Handing in work and submitting to Turnitin</h3>

  <p><b>Feedback:</b> will be given on work in progress during workshop sessions and in written form for assignments. The final assignment will be assessed within 20 days of the deadline.</p>

  <p><b>RemindeR</b>: all marks are provisional, subject to moderation, and will be ratified by the June Progress and Awards Board.</p>

  <p><b>Turnitin</b> the DMU Library has an excellent reference: [Frequently Asked Questions: Using TurnitinUK in Blackboard to submit your work](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14).</p>

  <h3>Assessment 0: (ongoing) active engagement</h3>

  <p>10% of overall marks</p>

  <p>Your contribution and development from active participation in workshops and lectures will be assessed throughout the duration of the module. You simply need to attend, engage with the learning materials and show good progress in your understanding, skills and main project.</p>
  <h3>Assessment 1: critical essay</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>25% of overall marks</li>
    <li>Deadline: 12pm Wednesday 1/11/2017 (week 5)</li>
    <li>Submitted: on Turnitin</li>

  <h4>Deliverable:</h4>

  <p>A 2000-word written essay, surveying and analysing 3 websites—they can all be different, or cover a theme or particular topic. For instance, a comparison of one kind of site (e.g. portfolios, sports, gaming, media, commerce…); or sites that show how a technology is used across each (e.g. Javascript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3 animations…).</p>

  <h4>What to look out for</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>are there any technical issues or faults in the code (e.g. invalid HTML, Javascript errors in the console)?</li>
    <li>how is the website content (pages, video, sound, gallery, forum, blog, chat, etc) delivered technically?</li>
    <li>does the site appear to use data from any external APIs - if so, how?</li>
    <li>can you find evidence of any frameworks, libraries, or other ready-made components (look for filenames in names JavaScript '.js' and style '.css' imports in the source code)?</li>
    <li>is the site responsive? If so, where are the breakpoints and how are they used?</li>
    <li>is the navigation effective or is some content hard to find? can you identify any usability issues or errors?</li>
    <li>is the source code readable and well-structured?</li>
    <li>is it a single-page app (SPA) or a series of pages?</li>
    <li>how are any user interaction animations or transitions generated?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Assessment 1 Marking criteria</h4>
  <h5>An understanding of front-end web code (60% of assignment mark):</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>A clear understanding of how HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript as used in the chosen websites.</li>
    <li>An understanding of any third-party code or frameworks.</li>
    <li>Knowledge of some current and industry-standard practice within front-end web development, with historical context.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h5>A well-structured essay (25% of assignment mark)</h5>
